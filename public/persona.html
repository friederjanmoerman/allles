          <h3>About the creator behind it all</h3>
          <p>
            Meet Leslie Page. Once a biomedical student dissecting the intricacies of the human body, she traded lab
            coats for sketchbooks and walked out of university with a Fine Arts degree—and a mind too curious to settle
            for the conventional.
          </p>

          <p>
            The next chapter? A whirlwind of movement, travel, and curiosity. From diving into yoga and Ayurvedic
            practices to immersing in the ancient wisdom of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the journey began with
            certifications in Personal Training and Sports Massage. Since then, TCM has become a lifelong pursuit,
            constantly deepening and evolving. Call it curiosity, call it passion. Call it the art of wonder and
            balance.
          </p>

          But movement and meridians aren’t the whole story. During years as a barista, it wasn’t just about perfecting
          frothy cappuccinos—it was an opportunity to cultivate a deep appreciation for taste, smell, and the way
          nourishment brings people together. With each expertly brewed espresso and deep dive into nutrition, the
          realization grew: health isn’t just about fueling the body; it’s about savoring life, one sip or bite at a
          time. For wellbeing, it’s about finding harmony through movement, nourishment, and delighting the senses.

          <p>
            Her philosophy is simple: health isn’t just the absence of illness; it’s a celebration of cycles, movement,
            and connection. Blending ancient wisdom with real-world practicality, her approach is playful,
            down-to-earth, and refreshingly free of incense clouds. She won’t promise instant enlightenment, but she
            might just teach you to breathe better, move smarter, and laugh at life’s absurdity—all while weaving in
            techniques that honor the rhythms of nature, body, and mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            No gimmicks, no fluff—just a clear invitation to find balance, live with ease, and embrace the beauty of
            life’s flow.
