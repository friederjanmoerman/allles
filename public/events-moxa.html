            <h3>Moxa, what?</h3> 
            <p>Moxa, or Mugwort, is the herb Artemisia Vulgaris, which has
            been used for centuries in Traditional Chinese Medicine. Known for its warming properties, Moxa stimulates
            the body's energy flow, or Qi, through heat.</p> 

            <h3>Moxa season!</h3>
            <p> The transition from autumn to winter is a sacred
            time in Chinese Medicine, as during this period the "life gate" (Ming Men) is open, allowing us to
            strengthen our body and immune system.</p>
            <p>According to the energetic seasonal calendar, this transition occurs
            in November. During this sensitive time, when our "life gate" is open, we are more vulnerable to illness,
            inflammation, and cold, which is why it coincides with the peak of cold season and flu. To protect ourselves
            from illness and cold, it is important that our body retains the warmth of summer throughout the winter.
            Moxa is an excellent way to add extra warmth to the body, giving our immune system an additional boost.</p> 

            <h3> What to expect?</h3> 
            <p>Goodie bag Silent Disco Guided meditation Total relaxation Immunity boost! In this session, we
            will use Moxa Heat Packs, which are placed on specific areas of your body. We will start with an
            introduction about the origin and benefits of Moxa, followed by a guided meditation. The aim is to bring
            warmth into your body through your "life gate," preparing it for the winter season. Think of it as a natural
            boost for your immunity.</p>
            <p> The Moxa packs will stay warm for at least 11 hours, so you can continue benefiting
            from the treatment at home. This traditional Chinese practice is considered a natural flu vaccine, both
            preventive and effective. Experience the benefits of this ancient technique and give your immune system a
            powerful boost!</p>
